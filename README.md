# Tourism-and-Hospitality-Management-System

### Background:
As an industry, Tourism, and Hospitality are important for the economic growth of the country. However, from a touristâ€™s point of view, planning out travel has always been a hassle and a time taking process. Through this project, we would like to build a Database Management System that would suffice all the challenges that a tourist faces in planning a trip and finding accommodation. The idea behind this project is to develop a database consisting of tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, local transportation, tour guides, emergency services, etc. Additionally, we plan to implement a feature that lets users socialize with those who are planning their travel on the same date and location.

### Objective:
-	To design an optimized database management system that can be used to pull out the right information in minimal time
-	To create an entity-relationship diagram that defines all the entities and their attributes 
-	To prepare datasets that can be as informative as needed for a tourist to plan their trip

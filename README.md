# Gathering, Scraping, Munging and Cleaning Data 

This project serves as one of the assignments completed for DAMG 6210 under Professor Nicholas Brown. The work has been done based on the learning recieved from regular lectures on data scraping, data munging/wrangling and data design in database.



## Background
As an industry, Tourism, and Hospitality are important for the country’s economic growth. However, from a tourist’s point of view, planning out travel has always been a hassle and a time taking process. Through this project, we would like to build a Database Management System that would suffice all the challenges that a tourist faces in planning a trip and finding accommodation. This project aims to develop a database consisting of tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, local transportation, tour guides, emergency services, etc. Additionally, we plan to implement a feature that lets users socialize with those who are planning their travel on the same date and location.

## Work done so far
In this assignment, team has focused on gathering the data from various sources, prepring the data to be fit for the data base, creating tables in SQL database and then inserting the infromation in it

- #### Data Gathering and Scraping
It is done to collect the tourism related data from Booking.com, Google, Kaggle and Trip Advisor. We have used various techniques to acheve the data collection, such as BeatifulSoup, selectorLib and kaggle downloads.

- #### Data Cleaning and Munging
It is done to prepare the datasets which is fit for data base. Various factors have been considered in cleaning of the data such as null treatment, column renaming, consistency check, accuracy check, data type conversion. Additionally, team audited data by representing the data through multiple visualizations like box plot, bar graphs, pie charts etc.

- #### Data Insertion to SQL DB
Insertion of data is achieved by using python commands and module like sql Alquemy and sqlodbc. The data is inserted in the data base and then we query the data for 15 used cases built for the system to be tested.
